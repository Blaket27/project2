Howdy!
My name is Corey Whitfield and I am a senior here at Texas A&M University. I came to this university to enroll in the Technology Management program so I can pursue a career as a Database Administrator. The reason why I want to be a Database Administrator is because I enjoy the complexity of dealing with SQL queries. I took a Database course last semester and I have to admit that I had fun trying to figure out the most simplistic but yet complicated problem. I thought to myself that I can spend the rest of life condcting this kind of work. Also, I would like to learn coding with the language java, python, and HTML. I like anything that challenges me to go beyond my limits.

So enough about school and the amazing career that is planned ahead of me, lets talk about me outside of all the serious stuff. :laughing:

:dog: In the photo above is my dog Conner. He is roc/lab, but he is one of the most playful, friendly, and sweetest dog that I have known. He currently doesn't live with me because my girlfriend thought it would be best if he lived with her. One of the games we like to play together is tug of war :muscle: He always win but only because I let him :laughing: One of the best thing I like about him is that he is very playful. He like to be chased around which helps me get my daily exercise in.:running:








I was told that I was one of the nicest most respectful people in the world.:smile: That doesn't mean I can't get :angry: though. Get out of line and I will
